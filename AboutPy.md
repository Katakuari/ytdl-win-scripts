## About the Python script
The Python script was written simply to have a more complete GUI.

The tools used to make this possible are
  - the [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) PyPI package
  - the [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package
  - the [FFmpeg essentials build by GyanD](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/), licensed under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

Thank you for using my script!
